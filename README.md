# Spectrum Auction Test Suite: Core API (sats-core)

### Getting Started
This getting started guide helps you to set up sats-core to use it as a library in your own java project afterwards. 
Should you not want to use it in your own code, you may want to use the command line tool (sats-clt) or the web application (sats-web) instead. See 
http://spectrumauctions.org for more information.
##### Prerequisites
Make sure to have `git`, `maven` and `JDK 1.8 (or later)` installed. 
##### Step 1: Install dependency
``git clone`` the gson-serializer repository (https://github.com/acebaggins/gson-serializers) 
and locally install it by running ``mvn clean install`` in the cloned repository.
##### Step 2: Install sats-core
``git clone`` the this repository and locally install it by running ``mvn clean install`` in the cloned repository.
##### Step 3: Add the maven dependency to your simulation project
````
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.spectrumauctions</groupId>
    <artifactId>sats-core</artifactId>
    <version>0.3.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
````
You can now use sats-core, which allows you to access and modify all of sats value models to generate value function instances for your simulations.
Should you require to use solve the winner determination problems, we recommend you to give sats-opt (see https://github.com/spectrumauctions/sats-opt) a try.
